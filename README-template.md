## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- desktop-first workflow



### What I learned

I learned that most of these challenges are harder than they look. I also used a lot of grid for the list items. I also went into the project trying to use BEM naming convention. That got confusing and the class names bagan to get really long. I also tried to use less css if i did not need to.


### Continued development
I would like to continue working on grid and Javascript in future projects. I dont think there are enough syntax tutorials IMO. It's one thing to watch someone type but to actually implement certain syntax is the most challenging for me.


### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://www.openai.com) - This helped me with the Javascript. I hope it stays free forever.
